## Product Requirements Document & Development Plan: PayHive

1. Product Vision & Problem Statement
Product Vision: To create the most seamless and intuitive consumer-facing application for splitting expenses among friends, powered by the efficiency and stability of PayPal USD (PYUSD) for settlements. PayHive will be a platform that delights end-users by removing the friction and social awkwardness of managing shared finances.

Problem Statement: Group travel and entertainment expenses are often a source of frustration, leading to manual tracking, delayed payments, and financial ambiguity. The app will solve this by providing a single source of truth for all shared expenses, ensuring transparency, accountability, and a simple mechanism for settlement using a familiar, dollar-pegged stablecoin.

2. Target Users
The Trip Planner: The person who organizes trips, events, or group dinners. They value accuracy, clear tracking, and an easy way to get paid back.

The Non-Crypto User: A typical individual who is not familiar with wallets, public keys, or blockchain but is comfortable with digital payments and a clean user experience.

The Group Member: Anyone participating in a shared activity who wants a simple way to see what they owe and pay their share without friction.

3. Core Features (Hackathon MVP Scope)
This document outlines the features to be developed within a 20-hour hackathon sprint, designed to meet all core requirements and create a compelling demonstration.

A. User Authentication & Onboarding:

Requirement: Must be built using Dynamic's APIs or SDK.

Functionality: Users will be able to sign up or log in using social logins (e.g., Google, Apple) or email. The Dynamic SDK will be used to provision a secure, non-custodial embedded wallet for each user in the background, abstracting away the crypto complexities.

B. Group Creation & Expense Management:

Requirement: A single trip/event may have multiple expenses.

Functionality:

Create Group: Any user can create a group for a trip (e.g., "Ski Trip to Colorado"). This group acts as a container for all shared expenses.

Add Expense: Within a group, a user can submit a new expense with a description, total amount, the payer, and the participants. The app will initially only support a simple, equal split among participants.

View Expenses: The group's dashboard will display a chronological list of all individual expenses submitted for that trip.

C. Simplified Authorization Flow:

Requirement: Payment needs to be authorized by at least half of the friends group.

Functionality:

Each expense in a group will have an "Approve" button visible to all members.

The UI will display the number of approvals (e.g., "2/4 Approved").

An expense is considered "authorized" once the number of approvals is equal to or greater than half the number of group members. This simplified logic demonstrates the core requirement without the need for complex multi-signature contracts within the hackathon timeframe.

D. The Ledger & Simulated Settlement:

Requirement: Uses Dynamic and PayPal (PYUSD).

Functionality:

Group Ledger: The app will maintain a simple ledger for each group, calculating who owes what based on the authorized expenses. The ledger will show a summary of what each person owes or is owed.

Simulated PYUSD Payment: For the demonstration, actual on-chain transactions will be simulated to save time. When a user clicks a "Settle Up" button, the app will update the ledger, showing the debt as paid and displaying a success message like "PYUSD Payment Initiated." This convincingly demonstrates the intended use of PYUSD without the complexities of a live transaction environment.

4. Technical Stack
Frontend: React, using a UI library like Tailwind CSS or Material UI for rapid component development.

Backend: Node.js (Express.js) or a serverless platform to manage group and expense data.

Web3 Integration: Dynamic SDK for user authentication and embedded wallet management.

Blockchain Interaction: For the hackathon, direct blockchain interaction will be simulated. In a production environment, the app would use an Ethereum library (like Ethers.js) to interact with the PYUSD token contract.

5. User Experience (UX) Goals
Intuitive & Clean: The UI will be minimalist, with clear calls to action and a straightforward flow.

Non-Crypto Jargon: The app will refer to PYUSD as "USD" to reduce friction for new users. The embedded wallet creation will be an invisible process.

Mobile-First Design: The application will be designed for mobile responsiveness, as group expenses are often managed on the go.

6. Hackathon Development Plan (20-Hour Sprint)
Phase 1: Foundation (Hours 1-5)

1-2: Project setup (frontend and backend repositories, dependencies). (Use Gemini to generate project boilerplate code.)

3-5: Implement Dynamic Authentication. Set up social login and embedded wallet creation. Verify that a user can successfully log in and that a wallet address is created.

Phase 2: Group & Expense Logic (Hours 6-12)

6-8: Backend API for Group Management. Create API endpoints for creating a group and adding members.

9-12: Frontend for Expense Submission. Build the UI for a form to add expenses and display them in a list within a group. (Use Gemini to generate React component code.)

Phase 3: The Core Experience (Hours 13-17)

13-15: Implement Authorization Logic. Add the "Approve" button and the approval counter on the front end, with backend logic to track approvals.

16-17: Build the Group Ledger View. Create the UI that calculates and displays a summary of who owes what based on the approved expenses.

Phase 4: Polishing & Demo (Hours 18-20)

18: Create the Simulated Payment. Implement the "Settle Up" button that triggers a state change to update the ledger.

19: Final UI Polish. Apply styling to make the app visually appealing and professional.

20: Demo Preparation. Test the full end-to-end flow and prepare a short, compelling presentation for the judges.

7. Future Enhancements (Post-Hackathon)
Full On-Chain Payments: Implement actual PYUSD transfers between Dynamic wallets.

Advanced Splitting: Add options to split expenses by percentage or specific amounts.

Notifications: Implement automated push notifications for payment reminders and deadlines.

Open-Source Release: Open-source the codebase to foster community development.
